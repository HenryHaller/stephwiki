<p> This website was launched on August 2018.Founder Steph wants to build a global information network to help and encourage people give their voices against sexual assault crimes. The first necessary thing is raising people's awareness on any type of physical and mental abuse. We believe everyone deserves well treated no matter it is in relationship, family, dating or any situation. Information at this website from all countries are searched by volunteer members. </p>
